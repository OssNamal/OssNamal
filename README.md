<h2>About Us</h2> 
The Open Source Society (OSS) at Namal University is more than just another tech society. We're a gateway to the global developer world, built on the principle of "learning by doing" and contributing to the real-world tech ecosystem.
Unlike other tech societies that primarily focus on webinars, competitions, or internal events, OSS empowers students to work on actual projects that impact developers and communities worldwide.
<h2> Mission & Vision <h2>
<p>To empower Namal students with the skills, mindset, and opportunities to become impactful open-source contributors through collaborative development and real-world projects.</p>
<p>To establish Namal University as a nationally and globally recognized hub for open-source innovation, where student-led contributions create lasting value in the tech world and local communities.</p>
